# GMPFilter

Preferential filtering method for gravity and magnetic anomalies

Step 1 Power spectrum analysis

Step 2 Preferential filtering method

Developed by Lianghui Guo.

# Principles

GMPFilter is a Matlab code of the preferential filtering method for potential-field (graivty and magnetic) anomaly separation based on Green equivalent-layer concept and Wiener filter, following the preferential continuation method by Pawlowski (1995). Compared to the conventional upward continuation and the preferential continuation, the preferential filtering method has the advantage of no requirement ofcontinuation height. The results show that the preferential filtering method produced better anomaly-separation than both the conventional low-pass filtering and the upward continuation.

# Prerequisites

The code being implemented in MATLAB, it requires the MATLAB software, which is licensed under the MathWorks sofware company. MATLAB can be downloaded at the following link https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/, and more information can be found about the license fee on the website.

# Usage

To launch the program, it just requires to dowload ‘Matlab_Code’ from my repositories and execute the script main_pf1_mcg.m and main_pf2_mcg.m on MATLAB.
